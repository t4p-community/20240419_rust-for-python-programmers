# Rust for Python Programmers

Welcome to the Rust for Python Programmers course! We designed this course to help you learn Rust if you already know Python. We'll cover the basics of Rust and compare them to Python so you can see the differences and similarities between the two languages.

## Getting Started

To utilize the DevContainer for this online course, fork this public repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page.

After forking, you can use GitHub Codespaces to run the code directly in your browser. Using a Codespace is the easiest way to get started with the course. Click the green "Code" button on your forked repository and select "Open with Codespaces" to start a new Codespace with the course materials.

GitHub provides a generous amount of free time for Codespaces each month (currently, 120 hours). You are responsible for any charges incurred if you exceed the free time. You can monitor your usage in the GitHub settings.

**IMPORTANT:** Because of the limited time for the course, if you run into setup problems, it will not be possible to provide individual support. If you have trouble setting up a local environment, we recommend using Codespaces. If you cannot set up a programming environment, please watch the class, and you can code along with the class recording later.

# Rust for Python Programmers

Welcome to the Rust for Python Programmers course! We designed this course to help you learn Rust if you already know Python. We'll cover the basics of Rust and compare them to Python so you can see the differences and similarities between the two languages.

## Getting Started

Using a Codespace created from this repository is the easiest way to get started with the course. Click the green "Code" button on `t4p-community/20240419_rust-for-python-programmers` and select "Open with Codespaces" to start a new Codespace with the course materials.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not create a Codespace on a fork of this repository. It will take 20-30 minutes to create the Codespace. If you create a Codespace on this repository directly, GitHub will use a preloaded Dev Container image. Codespaces created from preloaded Dev Containers are available to use almost immediately.

If you wish to save your changes, create a new GitHub repository, add it as a remote to your workspace, and push your changes to your repository.

GitHub provides a generous amount of free time for Codespaces each month (currently, 120 hours). You are responsible for any charges incurred if you exceed the free time. You can monitor your usage in the GitHub settings.

**IMPORTANT:** Because of the limited time for the course, if you run into setup problems, it will not be possible to provide individual support. If you have trouble setting up a local environment, we recommend using Codespaces. If you cannot set up a programming environment, please watch the class, and you can code along with the class recording later.

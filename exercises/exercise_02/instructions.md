# Exercise 2 - Car Tool

## Instructions

To complete the lab exercise, review the in-class demonstrations. This exercise combines code from the various demonstrations. Also, you may used generative AI tools, searching, and official documentation to complete the exercise.

### Code Folders - PLEASE READ

The starting code is located in the `begin` folder. The `begin` code has been copied to the `end` folder for you. Please make your changes to the code in the `end` folder. The solution for the exercise is located in the `solution`  folder. The solution is provided as a reference to help you understand the requirements of the exercise. Try to complete the exercise without referring to the solution.

## Steps

1. Move the `Car` struct and methods to their own module. Do not forget to mark parts of the code as `pub`. Run the program and ensure it still works.

2. Review the `ColorToolApp` struct and methods from the in-class demos. Program a similar struct and methods for the `CarToolApp` in its own module.

3. Copy the `CommandLoop` module from the in-class demo. Modify the `CommandLoop` module to work with the `CarToolApp` struct.

4. Update the `main.rs` file to use the `CarToolApp` and `CommandLoop` modules in the `main` function.

8. Run the program and test the functionality.
